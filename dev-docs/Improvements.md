## 2024-12-17 | Fixed Timer Not Stopping With Errors | Completion logic now works regardless of typing accuracy

The typing session timer was not stopping when users completed typing all characters but had made errors during the process. This created an infinite session with no completion feedback.

### Key Changes:

- Timer now always stops when user finishes typing the snippet
- Results display correctly even when errors are present
- All completed sessions are properly tracked in analytics
- Updated documentation to reflect new completion behavior

### Files Changed:
- `src/utils/metrics.ts` - Updated `compareTexts()` function completion logic
- `dev-docs/CPM_LOGIC.md` - Added completion logic documentation section

### Impact:
- âœ… **Better UX**: Users always get feedback when they finish typing
- âœ… **Accurate Analytics**: All completed attempts are recorded 
- âœ… **Reliable Timer**: No more infinite sessions due to typing errors
- âœ… **Clear Feedback**: Error count displayed alongside completion status
